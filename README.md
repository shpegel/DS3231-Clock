# DS3231-Clock
Collection of related data on the DS3231 Clock
I purchased a DS3231 clock kit from Aliexpress around October of 2019. I had to hunt around to find information and it was a bit of a pain. It is unlikely all the kits out there are identical but this should provide a nice starting point and should you like to add your constructive additions, please feel free to contact me.

There is a guide in this reepository that I wrote as the one in the instructions is hard for me to follow. Hope you find it useful.

There are plenty of youtubes that talk about soldering SMD as well as a few about the clock build. No point in duplicating that information here. 

It would be nice to see information on programming the MCU to do custom features as if you are like me, there are a few things you would change. 

If you are like me, you will enjoy this kit. Look around as the price can vary and they all seem to be about the same.
